          sleep longer to a total of 20 hours a day. These felines do most of

          night.

          Hereâ€™s one of our sweetest did you know facts about food. When honey
          is heated and strained and sealed properly, it will not be able to
          absorb moisture and therefore will stay as it is forever. The oldest
          jar of honey ever found is stated to be over 5500 years old today.

          On average, a person will share a birthday with 19 million other
          people from a population of over 7 billion. If you were born on the

          as 18 million people.

          This is because they cannot easily see the ground right after their
          feet. Their knees and hips also make it difficult for them to move at

          them off-balanced and possibly fall over.
